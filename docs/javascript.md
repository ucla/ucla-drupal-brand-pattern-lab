# Javascript documentation

## Babel
We are currently not using any javascript in our components, but should that become necessary we can place them in the `/src/js` folder. Javascript modules (ES6 or whatever) would have to be run through [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) so a [loader](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/babel-loader/) would have to be added to the build.
